🛠️ How to Use
Pick one topic per day

Solve problems before checking solutions

Focus on logic + edge cases

Revise previously solved problems

Track improvement daily

🧠 Learning Strategy
Consistency beats intensity.

One day → One concept

One problem → Multiple approaches

One solution → Clean explanation

💼 Interview Value
Covers frequently asked DSA patterns

Improves problem breakdown skills

Helps explain logic clearly in interviews

Strengthens Java implementation confidence

🛣️ Roadmap
Add more optimized solutions

Pattern-based problem sets

Company-specific DSA questions

Daily revision checklists

🚀 Final Note
DSA is not about memorization —
it’s about thinking clearly under pressure.

This repository is built to support that journey
one problem at a time.

Code daily. Think better. Grow stronger.
